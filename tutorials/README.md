# Tutorials

We aim to bridge the gap for anyone who are new signal processings to get started, check out the these tutorials to get started on signal processings.

### 1. Signal composition (time, sampling rate and frequency)

In order to begin the signal processing adventure, we need to understand what we are dealing with. In the first tutorial, we will uncover what is a signal, and what it is made up of. We will look at how the sampling rate and frequency can affect a signal. We will also see what happens when we combine multiple signals of different frequencies.

### 2. Fourier Transform

In the first tutorial, we learned that combining multiple signals will produce a new signal where all the frequencies are jumbled up. In this tutorial, we will learn about Fourier Transform and how it can take a complex signal and decompose it to the frequencies that made it up.

### 3. Denoising with mean-smooth filter

How can we apply the simplest filter to perform denoising? Introduce the running mean filter; we can remove noise that is normally distributed relative to the signal of interest.
